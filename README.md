Before installing the Node server, ensure your system has the necessary build tools:

### Ubuntu/Debian Systems
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```

### Alternative: Use the Setup Script
```bash
# Run the included setup script
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### Why build-essential is needed
The `build-essential` package provides:
- GCC compiler
- Make utility  
- Development libraries
- Other essential build tools

These are required for compiling native Node.js addons that some dependencies may use.

## Server

If you haven't already, install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-binaries).
### Clone the Project

```
git clone git@github.com:viktorholk/push-notifications-api.git
cd push-notifications-api/server
npm i
```
### Start the Server
```
npm run start
```

The app will by default run on port 3000 and the endpoint for the notification events are ``/events``

The port can be changed in the ``server/.env`` file

### API Reference

Replace `127.0.0.1:3000` with your IP and port

## üöÄ Recent Updates - Connection Stability Improvements

### Version 1.3.0 - Keep-Alive Enhancement

**Problem Solved:** The Android app connection was dropping after several minutes of inactivity.

**Solution Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Keep-alive heartbeat system (30-second intervals)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced socket configuration with TCP keep-alive
- ‚úÖ Automatic cleanup of dead connections
- ‚úÖ Extended socket timeout (5 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Graceful shutdown handling

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Keep-Alive Mechanism
```typescript
// Sends keep-alive messages every 30 seconds
const HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 30000;
```

#### Enhanced Socket Configuration
- **Socket Timeout:** Extended to 5 minutes (300,000ms)
- **TCP Keep-Alive:** Enabled at socket level with 30-second intervals
- **Nagle's Algorithm:** Disabled for better real-time performance
- **Connection Validation:** Automatic cleanup of broken connections

#### New Endpoints

##### Health Check
```http
GET /health
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "uptime": 12345.67,
  "activeConnections": 3,
  "totalNotifications": 42,
  "timestamp": "2025-07-20T18:29:00.000Z"
}
```

### üìä Connection Management

The server now actively manages connections with:
- **Real-time monitoring** of active connections
- **Automatic cleanup** of dead/broken connections
- **Enhanced logging** for connection events
- **Connection state validation** before sending data

### üß™ Testing Connection Stability

Use the included test script to verify connection stability:

```bash
cd server
./test-connection.sh
```

This will monitor the `/events` endpoint for 2 minutes and show keep-alive messages.

## System Requirements

Before installing the Node server, ensure your system has the necessary build tools:

### Ubuntu/Debian Systems
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```

### Alternative: Use the Setup Script
```bash
# Run the included setup script

- Make utility  
- Development libraries
- Other essential build tools

These are required for compiling native Node.js addons that some dependencies may use.

#### Server Logs
The server now provides detailed logging:
```
[20/7/2025 18:26:41] INFO Server is running on http://206.189.5.95:3000
[20/7/2025 18:26:41] INFO Heartbeat interval: 30000ms
[20/7/2025 18:27:11] INFO Sent keep-alive to 192.168.1.100
[20/7/2025 18:27:11] INFO Active connections: 2
```

#### Connection Events
- Client connections and disconnections
- Keep-alive message delivery
- Connection cleanup operations
- Error handling and recovery

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Connection Drops:** Resolved through keep-alive heartbeat mechanism
- **Dead Connections:** Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Network Timeouts:** Extended socket timeouts handle mobile network behavior
- **Error Handling:** Improved error recovery for network issues

### üì± Android App Compatibility

The improvements are transparent to the Android app:
- **No app changes required**
- **Maintains existing API compatibility**
- **Enhanced connection stability**
- **Better handling of mobile network conditions**

### üöÄ Performance Improvements

- **Reduced Connection Overhead:** Efficient keep-alive mechanism
- **Better Resource Management:** Automatic cleanup of dead connections
- **Improved Logging:** Better debugging and monitoring capabilities
- **Graceful Shutdown:** Proper resource cleanup on server termination
